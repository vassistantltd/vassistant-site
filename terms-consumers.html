  <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>
  These Terms and Conditions apply to the supply of services and goods by V Assistant Ltd (Company No. 15693541), a company registered in the United Kingdom. By engaging with our services, you agree to these Terms and Conditions. These terms are designed to comply with UK consumer protection laws.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Services Offered</strong><br>
  We provide virtual assistant services to sole traders, limited companies, and self-employed individuals. Services include, but are not limited to, admin support, bookkeeping, and travel bookings.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Supply of Goods</strong><br>
  Although our primary offering is services, we may sell digital or physical goods in the future. Goods will be delivered by email, download link, post, or any other agreed-upon method.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Consumer Eligibility</strong><br>
  Our services are available to consumers under formal agreement, including contracts completed via email. These Terms apply to individual consumers where applicable.</p>

  <p><strong>5. Ordering and Contracts</strong><br>
  All engagements are subject to a formal sign-up process, which may be completed electronically. Once accepted, a binding contract is formed.</p>

  <p><strong>6. Pricing and Payment</strong><br>
  Services are billed in advance and are payable by the 1st of each month unless otherwise agreed. Work will not commence until payment has been received.</p>

  <p><strong>7. Cooling-Off Period</strong><br>
  Consumers have the legal right to cancel their order within 14 days of contract formation or receipt of goods. To exercise this right, you must notify us in writing at vassistantLtd@outlook.com.</p>

  <p><strong>8. Refunds and Cancellations</strong><br>
  Refunds will not be issued for services that have already begun or been completed. For goods, returns are accepted within 14 days. Return postage is the customer’s responsibility. Any costs for work already performed will be deducted.</p>

  <p><strong>9. Data Protection</strong><br>
  We process sensitive data such as financial login details and bank information. Data will only be shared with third parties as necessary to perform the service or where required by law. Data is stored securely using agreed systems, including internal accounting software, and only with client consent.</p>

  <p><strong>10. Communication</strong><br>
  We typically communicate via email and WhatsApp. Clients must provide access credentials and task details for us to deliver our services.</p>

  <p><strong>11. Liability and Force Majeure</strong><br>
  Our liability is limited to the total cost of the service provided. We are not responsible for delays or failures caused by events outside our control, including but not limited to illness, internet outages, or natural disasters.</p>

  <p><strong>12. Termination</strong><br>
  Our contracts require a minimum 3-month commitment. After the initial term, either party may terminate the agreement with 30 days’ written notice.</p>
